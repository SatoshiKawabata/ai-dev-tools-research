# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built with TypeScript and Express. It includes user authentication and CRUD operations for managing todos.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd todo-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up the database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and update the connection details in `src/db.ts`.
5. Run the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Infrastructure Proposal

- Use a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure) for hosting the application.
- Use a managed database service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS) for database persistence.
- Implement a load balancer to distribute traffic as user numbers grow.
- Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy deployment and scaling.

## Future Scalability Considerations

- Implement microservices architecture to separate user authentication and todo management.
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
- Consider using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) for handling background tasks and improving responsiveness.
