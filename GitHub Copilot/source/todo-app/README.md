# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built with TypeScript and Next.js. It allows users to manage their todos with features for adding, editing, deleting, and updating todos. The application also includes user authentication functionality.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Add, edit, delete, and update todos
- Persistent data storage using a database
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Prisma (for database interactions)
- NextAuth.js (for authentication)
- CSS for styling

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**

   Make sure you have a database set up (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). Update the database connection string in the `.env` file.

   Run the following command to create the database schema:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

5. **Run the Application**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Docker Setup

To run the application using Docker, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file.

1. **Build and Run Docker Containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will start the application and the database in separate containers.

## Scalability Considerations

- **Database**: Use a managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database) to handle increased load and provide automatic scaling.
- **Load Balancing**: As user traffic increases, consider using a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple instances of the application.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Microservices**: As the application grows, consider breaking it into microservices for better maintainability and scalability.
